I'm a Chemist working on drug design. I've been working on docking, binding affinity calculation and affinity optimization since my college project. I've been digging in nature inspired algorithms and its aplication on drug design. I also love Physical Chemistry in general. In my free time I like to write some hopefully useful programs.
